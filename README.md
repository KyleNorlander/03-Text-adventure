My own text adventure.

I tried to create a looping horror story based on the zork.json file. I included an inventory to "help" the player progress in the story, such as mentioning a broken lock next to the cellar door. I would have liked to include a time mechanic which would only allow the player 7 seconds to make a decision (as it is a horror game) until they wake up and have to try again. Although this game isn't that mechanically intensive, I thought a creative story could make up for it.
