My own text adventure.

I tried to create a horror story based on the zork.json file. I included a trap in the cellar basement which the informs you as the player to "kill the terminal". I alsoincluded an inventory to "help" the player progress in the story, such as mentioning a broken lock next to the cellar door. I would have liked to include a time mechanic which would only allow the player 7 seconds to make a decision (I mean it is a horror game) until they "wake up and have to try again" (return to start). Although this game isn't that mechanically intensive, I tried to incorporate a creative story to make up for it.
